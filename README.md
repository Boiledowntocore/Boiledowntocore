### Hey there, I'm @Boiledowntocore! 👋

You might be wondering, "What's up with this GitHub profile?" Well, let me spill the beans.

🧐 **I’m interested in...**
- Dreaming about the amazing things I could build with computer science knowledge, even though I'm not officially a CS student. 🚀

🌱 **I’m currently learning...**
- JavaScript in a way that might make some CS majors raise an eyebrow. 🤨
- How to decipher cryptic error messages (they're like secret codes, right?). 🤫

💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on...**
- Anything related to AI, ML, or computer vision! If you're patient enough to teach a JavaScript newbie like me, I'm all ears (well, eyes, since we're on GitHub). 👓

📫 **How to reach me...**
- You can't reach me faster than my code crashes, but you can try [sending a smoke signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_signal) in my general direction. It might work. 🚬

**P.S.** If you're here to witness a spectacular mix of coding brilliance and epic fails, you're in the right place. 🌟🤣
